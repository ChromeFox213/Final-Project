# Final-Project-Proposal

## Project Overview
I plan to make a cool '2.5D'/3D game that takes place in space! The player fully controls a fox in a spaceship in a top-down/3rd-person POV, using 'WASD' to maneuver and dodge asteroids while shooting and reducing the amount of 'hostiles' on screen that follow the player, before the player is overwhelmed and eventually intersects with any of the 'hostiles' or asteroids. Any intersection with any asteroid or 'hostile' immediately ends the game, and much like flappy bird, there is no ending, just a point system that only rises overtime (+ amount of hostiles defeated). If I can't find models online, I'll happily make pixel art sprites, or model 3D shapes for each object.

## Project Schedule
**Week 1**: Look for inspiration, decide on art style, model type, make any needed changes, and have a fully fledged vision/story of the game.

**Week 2**: Have the top-down view of the fox, rendered in space, with its spaceship, fully functional and moving using the WASD keys. Have a visible point system, and begin incorporating asteroid and enemies and physics.

**Week 3**: Have asteroids and enemies fully loaded, with 'hostile' AI tracking the player. Alongside the spaceship's defense mechanism (whether it'd be as simple as shooting lasers, or some kind of reflector). I really want this game to be unique and fun.

**Week 4**: Polish up the game's difficulty, UI, presentation, point system, and put together presentation.

## Project Technical Requirements
I'm not sure what's best for this project but I intend to start with Three.js and Javascript and see if that works best for me.
